There are many ways to structure code. Different languages and frameworks often favour different styles, both for historical reasons and because of the strengths, weaknesses and design trade-offs of the languages.

Some common concepts in relation to each of these styles include (but aren't limited to):

    OOP: Classes, inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism
    FP: Functions, closures, higher-order functions, composition
